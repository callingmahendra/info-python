It seems like you provided a large amount of code, but I'll try to extract the relevant information for you.

Based on your request, it appears that you want to combine data from different sources (Flat File and Oracle Database) into a single output. However, there are duplicates and inconsistencies in the provided code.

To provide a clear answer, let's focus on the two tables/files that seem to be the most relevant:

**PAY_PERIOD_MESSAGE_FILE**

* System: Flat File
* Data Fields:
	+ `SUBJECT`: string data type ( FIELDNUMBER="1")
	+ `MESSAGE`: string data type (FIELDNUMBER="2")

**PAY_PERIOD**

* System: Oracle Database
* Data Fields:
	+ `PP_NUM`: number, precision 2, scale 0
	+ `PP_END_YEAR`: number, precision 4, scale 0
	+ `PP_START_DTE`: date data type
	+ `PP_END_DTE`: date data type
	+ `LV_NUM`: number, precision 2, scale 0
	+ `LV_YEAR`: number, precision 4, scale 0
	+ `PAY_DTE`: date data type
	+ `CURR_PP_FLAG`: varchar2 data type

Now, let's assume you want to create a report that combines the data from these two tables/files. Here's an example summary of what the output could look like:

**Report Output:**

* Subject: [value from PAY_PERIOD_MESSAGE_FILE]
* Message: [value from PAY_PERIOD_MESSAGE_FILE]
* PP Number: [value from PAY_PERIOD]
* End Year: [value from PAY_PERIOD]
* Start Date: [value from PAY_PERIOD]
* End Date: [value from PAY_PERIon]
* Latest Payment Date: [value from PAY_PERIOD]
* Current Pay Period Flag: [value from PAY_PERIOD]

This report output is just an example, and you can customize it to fit your specific needs.

As for the code to generate this report, it would depend on how you plan to process the data from each source. If you're using a programming language like SQL or Python, I'd be happy to provide some sample code to get you started!
