# Informatica PowerCenter to Python Migration Project: Workflow Documentation

**Workflow Name:** [Workflow Name Here]

**1. Workflow Description:**

*   [Brief description of the workflow's purpose and overall functionality. 
    *   e.g., "This workflow extracts daily sales data from the Oracle database, performs data cleansing and transformations, and loads the cleansed data into the Snowflake data warehouse."] 

**2. Source and Target Definitions:**

*   **Source:**
    *   System: [e.g., Oracle Database, Flat File, etc.]
    *   Tables/Files: [List of source tables/files]
    *   Data Fields: [List of source data fields with data types]
*   **Target:**
    *   System: [e.g., Snowflake, AWS S3, etc.]
    *   Tables/Files: [List of target tables/files]
    *   Data Fields: [List of target data fields with data types]

**3. Mapping Details:**

| Source Field | Target Field | Transformation Logic |
|---|---|---|
| Source_Field1 | Target_Field1 | Direct Map |
| Source_Field2 | Target_Field2 | Data Type Conversion (e.g., String to Date) |
| Source_Field3 | Target_Field3 | Expression Transformation (e.g., Calculate Age) |
| Source_Field4 | Target_Field4 | Lookup Transformation (e.g., Enrich data from a lookup table) |
| ... | ... | ... |

**4. SQL Queries and Stored Procedures:**

*   [List of SQL queries used in the workflow, including:
    *   Source Qualifier queries
    *   Expression Transformation logic
    *   Filter Transformation conditions]
*   [List of stored procedures used in the workflow, including:
    *   Name of the stored procedure
    *   Input parameters
    *   Output parameters
    *   Brief description of the procedure's functionality]

**5. Business Rules and Logic:**

*   [Describe any specific business rules or logic implemented in the workflow, such as:
    *   Data validation rules
    *   Data quality checks
    *   Conditional logic for data routing
    *   Error handling mechanisms]

**6. Notes and Observations:**

*   [Any additional notes or observations relevant to the migration, such as:
    *   Known limitations or constraints
    *   Performance considerations
    *   Potential challenges for Python implementation]

**7. Migration Considerations:**

*   [Specific considerations for migrating this workflow to Python, such as:
    *   Required Python libraries
    *   Data access methods (e.g., database connectors, file handling)
    *   Data transformation libraries (e.g., pandas, NumPy)
    *   Testing and validation strategies]

**This is a template. Please adapt it to your specific needs and the complexity of each workflow.**

This template provides a structured approach to document each Informatica PowerCenter workflow. By consistently applying this template, you will create a valuable repository of information that will significantly aid the migration process to Python.
