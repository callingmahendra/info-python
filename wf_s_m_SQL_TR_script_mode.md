# Informatica PowerCenter to Python Migration Project: Workflow Documentation

**Workflow Name:** wf_s_m_SQL_TR_script_mode

**1. Workflow Description:**

*   This workflow reads SQL scripts from a flat file, executes them, and writes the results and errors to a target flat file.

**2. Source and Target Definitions:**

*   **Source:**
    *   System: Flat File
    *   Tables/Files: Ins_Scripts
    *   Data Fields: 
        *   FIELD1 (string, 56)
*   **Target:**
    *   System: Flat File
    *   Tables/Files: tgt_file
    *   Data Fields: 
        *   ERROR (string, 500)
        *   RESULT (string, 500)

**3. Mapping Details:**

| Source Field | Target Field | Transformation Logic |
|---|---|---|
| FIELD1 | ScriptName | Direct Map |
| ScriptError | ERROR | Direct Map |
| ScriptResult | RESULT | Direct Map |

**4. SQL Queries and Stored Procedures:**

*   No SQL queries or stored procedures are used in this workflow.

**5. Business Rules and Logic:**

*   Data validation rules:
    *   Ensure FIELD1 is not null.
*   Data quality checks:
    *   None
*   Conditional logic for data routing:
    *   None
*   Error handling mechanisms:
    *   Log errors and continue processing.

**6. Notes and Observations:**

*   Known limitations or constraints:
    *   None
*   Performance considerations:
    *   Ensure efficient handling of large flat files.
*   Potential challenges for Python implementation:
    *   Handling large data volumes efficiently.

**7. Migration Considerations:**

*   Required Python libraries:
    *   pandas
*   Data access methods:
    *   File handling
*   Data transformation libraries:
    *   pandas
*   Testing and validation strategies:
    *   Unit tests for data transformations
    *   Integration tests for end-to-end workflow
